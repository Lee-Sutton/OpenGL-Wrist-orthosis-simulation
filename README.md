# Robotic Wrist Device Simulation

## Project Info:
This repository contains my work for an individual course project conducted in my first term of my Master's in Engineering at Simon Fraser University. The project was submitted for my Introduction to Robotics Class. The project was meant to touch on some of the principles we examined in class including joint angles, smooth joint movment, forward kinematics, and inverse kinematics. Although the code is written in C++ I was still very new to OOP at the time but I was familiar with declaritive programming styles commonly used in C. For 

I chose to simulate the movements of a robotic wrist orthosis before building the device. A single degree of freedom device was eventually built and the results were published at the BioRob conference in Singapore in March 2016. The conference paper can be downloaded from my research gate page: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lee_Sutton2

## Instructions for use:
The project was built in xcode and requires:
- OpenGL
- Glut
- GLUI
The code should compile with windows with the appropriate libraries installed but I have not personally tried. 

## Screenshots
Below I have attached a few screenshots of the project in use.
